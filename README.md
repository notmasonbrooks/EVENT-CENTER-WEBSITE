I started with the home page and felt confident with the source code i was given. I believe it turned out pretty good, i like how the nav bar works some of the small animations when opening or switching pages.

When working on the other pages I experimented with background images but was having trouble with keeping the sizing clean when the page size differed.

The footer was giving me trouble while i was working with the background images so i took it off of the pages that it wasnt working on. 

I tried to experiment with different techniques on each page to see what i was able to do and get more fammiliar with the syntax while still maintaining a level of cohesiveness throughout the website using color schemes.
